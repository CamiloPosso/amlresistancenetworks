## Get Data

This package has formatted the Gilteritnib-treated AML cells into a tidied data frame so they can be easily processed. 

```{r Load Data}
gilt.data<-readRDS(system.file('gilteritinibData.Rds',package='amlresistancenetworks'))

#view as table
```

## Compute Fold changes for conditions of interest


Here is the meat of the challenge - compute significant LFCs for each condition.

```{r LFC heatmap, echo=FALSE}
library(pheatmap)

```
## Compute raw differences between ligand treatments
