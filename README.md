All data for this project is stored on [Synapse](http://synapse.org/ptrc). To gain access to the data you must request access until it is made available for publication.

### BEAT AML Proteogenomic Pilot project.
This project is the primary driver of methods development, as it uses diverse omics measurements to ascertain the impact that proteomics can have in drug response prognosis.

### Cell Line Time Course Data
Data collection underway.

### Elements of Early vs. Late Resistance
This manuscript, by Joshi et al, has been submitted for publication.

### Effects of Cytokines on drug resistance
This project led by the Agarwal lab is currently in process.
