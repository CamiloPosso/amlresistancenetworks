# AML Resistance Networks

This package supports a series of projects that analyze various aspects of AML progression, drug sensitivity and drug resistance. 

## PTRC Projects
The individual project files are listed in the [./results/] directory. These are supported through the NCI CPTAC PTRC work shared by OHSU and PNNL. 

All data for this project is stored on [Synapse](http://synapse.org/ptrc). To gain access to the data you must request access until it is made available for publication.
